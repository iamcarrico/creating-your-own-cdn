Creating Your Own CDN
=====================

One of the biggest factors in the performance of a site is the latency between the user and the server. The best way to decrease latency is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN), but sometimes standard products won’t always fit within your needs. This is how I built my own!

You will learn:

* Why it is so important to get content to the user
* Managing several different servers with Ansible playbooks
* Setting up Amazon’s DNS (Route 53) to handle latency-based DNS
* Deploying to multiple servers at once with DeployBot
