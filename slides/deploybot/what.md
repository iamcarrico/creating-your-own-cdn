## What is deploybot?

Note:
DeployBot is a happy little robot that can help automate your deployment to your servers. It does not tempt you with cake, as we know the cake is a lie anyway. It monitors a repository (GitHub or others) for changes on a branchâ€” when a change happens it can either automatically deploy or manually deploy changes to any number of servers.
