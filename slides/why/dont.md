## Dont do this

Note:

Generally speaking, there are a LOT of great CDN providers out there that can do a lot of this heavy lifting for you. Before I did this work, I first tried to use them. However, my needs were— special. Because I wanted to have two different sites depending on the status of a cookie's existance— the only way I could use a standard CDN was to pay upwards of $5k/month. Slightly out of my budget.
