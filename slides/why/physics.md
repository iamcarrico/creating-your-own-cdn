## E = MC^2


Note:

It takes about 133.67587 ms for a ray of light to travel the globe— if it were in a vacuum. Your data travels slower than that, much slower.

We are limited by pure physics. Data can only travel so fast through the series of tubes that is the internet— we are limited by physics (and the "last mile" stretch). Even just getting between NY and London can be as high as 90ms alone.
