## Cache money

Note:
The problem is, this technique requires a CDN that will allow different pages to be sent depending on the value of a cookie. Many CDNs allow this... for their enterprise plans. Although I am not hurting for money, ~$5k/mo. is slightly out of my budget.

So I did thisâ€” and that costs me ~$25/mo. with servers in 4 different locations.
