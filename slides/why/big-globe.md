## The globe is a big place

Note:

The globe is a big place. Really big. And the web covers all of it, our users can come from anywhere— and for many sites they do come from everywhere across the globe. We want to make sure our site gets content to each user as fast as possible— and since our goal is less than 1000ms— we don't want to waste any time to get our data moving.
