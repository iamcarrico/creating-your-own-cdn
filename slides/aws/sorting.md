## Sorting

Note:
Route 53 allows for latency-based DNS routing. Simply put: it sorts traffic to the server closet to them (based on latency). There is a slight downside, which is that it is based off the locations of Amazon's datacentersâ€” not necessarily where your servers are. Luckily, my servers were in the same city as where Amazon's server farms are thus making this work very well.
