## Route 53

### DNS made easy

Note:
A while back, I moved all of my primary DNS over to AWS Route 53. There are a couple of reasons for thisâ€” first off I wanted failover in case my DNS host failed or went under a DDOS attack (which did happen once). But mostly, I wanted some of the advanced DNS features that AWS has to make creating a CDN easier.
