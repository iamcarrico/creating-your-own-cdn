## All the server things

Note:
Ansible makes setting up and configuring servers easy. With some work in YML files, you can setup, and configure a server quickly and easily. This is incredibly important to have multiple servers setup in the cloud, and keeping them all the same.

Ansible is VERY similar to what other tools, such as Chef, doâ€” but I find it to be much easier to work with.
