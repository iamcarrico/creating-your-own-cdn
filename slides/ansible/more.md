Note:
This is just a quick intro on WHAT Ansible can do. There are many more things that Ansible is capable of, as well as plenty of documentation, examples, etc online. The link above is what I use for my servers, which includes both the setup script, and configuration script. More links below:

* [Ansible documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/)
* [Ansible Galaxy (community roles)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
* [GitHub repos for examples](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ansible+role)
